# cf-email-obfuscator
ColdFusion Port of Email Obfuscator by Tim Williams, Andrew Moulden, and Ross Killen.

I came across a StackExchange article that spoke about email obfuscation, which lead to a PHP function that could generate obfuscated emails. So I have copied and tweaked the PHP code to work in a CFML engine.
